# Put the relative path to your definition files in the sequence they should run.
#
# Most definitions should go in the default list. These will be dropped and
# recreated every migration.
#
# Definitions that should not automatically be dropped and created can be put in
# different lists. This is useful for definitions that make take prohibitively
# to drop and create every migration such as check constraints.
#
# Run alternative sequences by specifying sequences in order to migrate command.
# Example: rake migrate sequences=expensive,default
#
# default:
#   - ultimate_answer.sql
# expensive:
#   - super_slow_check_constraint.sql

default:
  - widgets_view.sql
